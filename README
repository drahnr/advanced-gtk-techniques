Advanced GTK Techniques

This is a tutorial for advanced GTK programming. It is written for people who have passed the stage of learning how GTK works and want to know how to program more advanced, real-world applications. Things that will be covered include creating your own widgets and cell renderers, writing dynamic user interfaces, and more.

Right now the tutorial is written in LaTeX using the Listings package. The first thing I will do is port it to Mallard (projectmallard.org) since this is a much more suitable format.
