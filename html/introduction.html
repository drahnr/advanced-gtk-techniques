<p class="p">I decided to write this guide after reading the excellent book <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em"><a href="http://gtkbook.com" title="http://gtkbook.com">Foundations of GTK+ Development</a></span> by Andrew Krause.
The book does a wonderful job of describing GTK's most-used widgets and how to use them, and even though I had already had a certain amount of experience with GTK, reading it taught me several tricks I didn't know.
There is also a section on writing your own widgets, but I found it a little too short to really get into the nitty-gritty.
So, I thought I'd share some of the stuff that I had to find out through trial and error.</p>
<p class="p">My intended audience is people who are able to get to the end of <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em">Foundations</span> without their brains exploding, and are capable of programming a small application in GTK.
You don't literally have to have read the book, of course, but it will help to have done so, since I won't be covering things in great detail that the book already covered.
If you have some experience with GTK, you should be able to get by without reading it.
If you are a GTK beginner, I suggest you do read it, or some other tutorial, or do some programming and read the GTK docs as you go, if that's your preferred way of learning things.</p>
<p class="p">If you have a reasonable amount of experience with GTK, GLib, and GObject, you will know about the naming scheme for GObject classes.
The classes in this guide will use the namespace prefix <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" code">P</span>, which is the first letter of my name, and easy to type and pronounce.
After all, it's my tutorial.</p>
